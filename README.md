# Code Refactor Starter Code

This is my attempt to refactor the code from the urban-octo-telegram repository.

## First Steps

I reviewed the source code and replaced most of the div elements with the correct semantic elements. Then I restructured them to make sure it looked nice while also organizing it with comments

## Acceptance Criteria 

I moved down the list of acceptance criteria and made sure the elements followed a logical structure, added alt attributes to images, added a title attribute to the div of the background image, made sure heading attributes were accurate, and made a concise descriptive title.
